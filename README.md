# API Technical Studies

This repository contains a Java-based API created for **technical studies and experimentation with backend concepts**.  
The project serves as a sandbox to explore **scalable architectures, asynchronous processing, and observability tools** commonly used in real-world systems.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to progressively implement and study advanced backend concepts, including:

- ✅ RESTful API development with **Java & Spring Boot**
- 🔍 Integration with **Elasticsearch** for efficient searching and indexing
- 📊 Visualization and monitoring using **Kibana**
- 📨 Implementation of **message queues** for request and processing flows
- ⚙️ Asynchronous and concurrent processing in Java
- 🧵 Understanding Java async patterns (`CompletableFuture`, async executors, messaging)
- 🏗️ Foundations for scalable and decoupled system design

---

## 🛠️ Technologies (Planned & In Use)

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Maven**
- **Elasticsearch**
- **Kibana**
- **Message Queue** (to be defined – e.g. RabbitMQ / Kafka)
- **Docker** (for local infrastructure)
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## 🚧 Project Status

🚀 **In active development**  
Features will be added incrementally as new concepts are studied and validated.

---

## 📌 Motivation

This project was created as a **learning-oriented API**, focusing on practical backend engineering problems such as:
- handling asynchronous workloads
- decoupling services via messaging
- improving observability
- preparing systems for growth and scalability

---

## 📚 Notes

This repository is intended for **study purposes**, but follows patterns and practices commonly found in production-grade backend systems.
